## Main idea of my project: A distance sensoring vehicle which can be controlled through Processing control interface

### Some techical key points:

### The vehicle: DC motors, distance sensors, LED and buzzer

When the sensor senses an object of a minimum distance, the information is sent to Processing and will be reflected on the control interface. At the same time, the LED will blink and a warning sound will be played on the buzzer

### Processing program
The interface will have four arrows to signify how we want to control the robot and three other signalling boxes to reflect if the vehicle is powered and whether it encounters obstacles

Also, there will be a 2D model of the vehicle looking from above which reflects the direction of the vehicle in real time.

If time permitted, I also want to add other output and input devices on the vehicle whose changes in state will be reflected on the control interface.

### P/s: I am confident that I will be able to finish these features in time since I already have my interface nearly finished and I have been able to figure out my communication method between Processing and Arduino through the Serial port
