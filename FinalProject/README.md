## Introduction

Since I have always been fond of WALLE (who is a famous movie character), I decided that I will try to recreate this character using the knowledge I have gained
in this class. The robot will have a control interface in which users can control the robot and see the changes in the state of the robot in real time. The robot 
itself can move forward, backward and rotate left and right. When it encounters and object, an alarm will be played and 2 LEDS will blink. The features that
I find the most realistic about the robot compared to WALLE are that it has two wheels and when I turn the robot on it will say "WALLLLLEEE" (which is so cute:( )
and that the robot can practically "dance" (through wide degree rotation) like a real WALLE.
